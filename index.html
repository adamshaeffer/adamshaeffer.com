            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>I'm pretty new to the software engineering game, but I'm doing my best to learn as much as I can and gain the much needed experience. All things considering I have progressed really quickly and learned a lot on my own!</p>
            <p>I started down the path of logic and mathematics from a very young age, being placed in the gifted program for creative and quantitative learning in the first grade. I continued to excell in math and problem-solving completing the most advanced courses with fantastic grades all through High School. I even got the highest mathematics score in the history of my Elementary School in the NWEA standardized test.</p>
            <p>I was finally introduced to programming my Sophomore year of High School when I took the Honors Computer Programming 1-2 class. I instantly fell in love with programming and started making games and solving complex problems in Java. After learning the basics, my progress was halted somewhat when the school took the class off their curriculum. Although I wasn't learning professionally, I continued to do personal projects and do stuff on my own.</p>
            <p>I then went on my mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Brazil, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Texas. During my mission, I had to learn to adapt to many different situations and peoples in order to reach my goals. Many things came up that weren't planned for, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, but I continued to help and serve the people where I found myself. I also had opportunities to lead among the other missionaries, teaching and training dozens of missionaries, and analyzing the effectiveness of about one-hundred missionaries.</p>
            <p>After coming home from my two-year volunteer mission, I jumped right back into my learning about programming. I created this website, continued solving problems from Project Euler, and started looking into new methods of making games. After 4 months, I started college at Arizona State University and resumed my official learning.</p>

                        <p>I have spent a lot of time learning with Project Euler, complex mathematical problems that would be impossible to solve by hand, but with programming, are made quite doable. I have so far solved the first 30 problems in Project Euler.</p>
                        <p>This GitHub link will take you to the programs I have written to solve these problems.</p>

                        <p>Over the years as a programmer, I have written a bunch of code to do some silly or pointless things. They might be assignments, challenges, or just something I wanted to do.</p>
