            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <br>
            <p>I'm currently a freshman at Arizona State University studying computer science. Before college, I had been learning how to code on my own, except for the class I took my sophomore year of high school. So, despite my being a freshman, I actually have a lot of experience and have made some pretty great things!</p>
            <p>I'm trying to learn as much as possible right now during college. I joined the school's Machine Learning Club to learn more about algorithms and get a start relating to artificial intelligence. Outside of class, I'm usually working on some personal projects. I've made some games on Pico-8, created this portfolio, and completed some of the challenges offered by LeetCode and Project Euler.</p>
            <p>I recognize that the most efficient way to become a more skilled programmer is through real work experience. I've been seeking internships and more personal projects with that purpose in mind. Programming is something I really like to do, and I love learning new things and conquering some challenging code.</p>

                        <p>This is the first website I ever made! I made the whole thing with about 100 hours of work. When I started this project, I knew nothing about web development, and learned everything necessary for this project with Google and YouTube!</p>
                        <p>Feel free to take a look at the code I wrote to design this website in the GitHub link! While you're at it, you can look at some of the other projects I've done or participated in.</p>

                        <p>I have spent a lot of time learning with Project Euler. Project Euler has a lot of complex mathematical problems that would be impossible to solve by hand, but with programming, are made quite doable. I have so far solved the first 30 problems in Project Euler.</p>
                        <p>This GitHub link will take you to the programs I have written to solve these problems.</p>

                        <p>Over the years as a programmer, I have written a bunch of code to do some silly or pointless things. They might be assignments, challenges, or just something I wanted to do.</p>
                        <p>Follow the link to my GitHub repository that contains much of that code!</p>
