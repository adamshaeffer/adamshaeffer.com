                game and web design.</p>
            <p class="meinfo" id="ceh">I recently returned from a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of 
                Latter-Day Saints and I am now learning as much possible about developing before I start college 
                at ASU in January 2022.</p>

            <div class="colmain" id="mebio">
                <p class="meinfo" id="ceh"> I graduated from Marcos de Niza High School in May 2019 with a 4.0 
                    unweighted GPA and 4.83 weighted in the top 5 of the graduating class. From August 2019 till 
                    September 2021 dedicated my time and talents to serve and teach people in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil; South 
                    Dakota, Nebraska, and Texas. As a leader during my mission, I also taught and trained dozens of 
                    other missionaries as they also serve. I also served in a special capacity as the statistics and 
                    technology secretary, overseeing and analyzing an entire region.</p>
