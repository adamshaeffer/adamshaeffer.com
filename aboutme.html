            <p class="meinfo">As I said, my name is Adam Shaeffer, and I'm a junior developer in both 
                game and web design.</p>
            <p class="meinfo">I recently returned from a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of 
                Latter-Day Saints and I am now learning as much possible about developing before I start college 
                at ASU in January 2022.</p>

                <p>I first started programming in a class my Sophomore year at high school, at the recommendation of my two older brothers who are now both developers as well!
                    The class was mostly about game development and every student learned to code in Java. I quickly began to learn more and more, going above and beyond.
                    I had an uncommon ability to solve coding related problems, and even began to help some of the students who were taking the class for the second or third time!
                    I instantly knew that I wanted to make a career out of programming and have sought many opportunities to grow in skill and knowledge.
