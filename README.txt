This is my portfolio as a software engineer.

This is the first website I ever programmed, and am happy to say that it is really cool. I made the whole thing in about 100 hours. When I started the project, I
knew nothing about web development, and everything I learned for this project, I learned from Google, YouTube, and friends.

Check out the website! It's pretty cool.
